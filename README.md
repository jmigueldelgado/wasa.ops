# wasa.ops
A collection of functions for dealing with the topological structure required by the model [wasa](https://github.com/TillF/WASA-SED).
For now only conversion between routing table and strahler order is implemented. Other functions exist but are spread around other repositories. With time they should be added to this repo.
